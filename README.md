Key Concepts:
HTML:


CSS:
0. Where to define styles? 
    - External CSS file + reference it in html
    - "style" element in html head
    - "style" property in individual element
1. Block Model -> every html element is actually a box
2. Block properties -> Margin, Border, Padding
3. display -> block, inline, inline-block
4. Parent-Child -> z dimension stacking
5. Font family -> a fallback model
6. Font embedding

Hosting webpage
================
1. Host using Github (free)
   
2. Buy a domain name (eg. myfarm.com)
    - https://namecheap.com (different pricing : $8-10/year)
    - https://domains.google/intl/en_sg ($12/year)

3. Change the domain name of your github pages!
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwOV_UaIXcU

Old webpage url = https://vongxx.github.io/webbootcamp/HTML_PersonalSite/
New webpage url = https://myfarm.com/HTML_PersonalSite/

*Note*  GitHub has a soft 100GB/mth bandwidth limit! 
Github only can host Static page (Html/CSS/Javascript) 
If need dynamic feature (eg. show different things to diff people), Can use Firebase -> Google Cloud BackendAsAService (Got free version)
Firebase (Free) limitations: 
100 max concurrent connections
10GB transfer
1 GB storage


If using Github to host pages, recommended to use Cloudflare as an intermediary (CDN, DNS, DDoS protection) + give a free SSL Cert
